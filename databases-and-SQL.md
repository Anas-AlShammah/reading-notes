# Summary of Relational Databases and SQL Understanding

In this prework, I embarked on a journey to learn about relational databases and SQL. Here is a summary of my understanding and progress:

## Learn SQL E-book

I downloaded the free e-book, "Learn SQL," and skimmed through its contents. The book provided a comprehensive introduction to SQL and relational databases, covering important concepts such as tables, relationships, and querying data.

## SQL Bolt Tutorials

I completed two sets of tutorials on SQL Bolt, focusing on SQL Queries and Database Management:

### SQL Queries (Lessons 1-6)

In this section, I learned how to write SQL queries to retrieve data from tables. I practiced using the SELECT statement, filtering results with WHERE clauses, sorting data, and performing joins. These exercises helped me gain confidence in constructing effective queries.

### Database Management (Lessons 13-18)

The Database Management tutorials delved into advanced topics related to managing databases. I learned about creating tables, altering their structure, and deleting them. Additionally, I explored concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, and data integrity constraints. These lessons provided valuable insights into maintaining and organizing databases effectively.

## Summary of Understanding

Through this prework, I have developed a strong understanding of relational databases and SQL. I now grasp the fundamentals of working with tables, querying data, and managing databases. The practical exercises in the SQL Bolt tutorials have been instrumental in solidifying my knowledge and skills.
