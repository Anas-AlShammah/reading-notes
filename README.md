## Features of Markdown

In this README.md file, I have utilized the following features of Markdown:

1. Headings: I have used level-1 and level-2 headings to structure the content.
2. Links: Each course heading is linked to its respective Markdown file.
3. Lists: I have used bullet-point lists to list the courses and their associated notes.
4. Emphasis: I have used emphasis, such as bold and italic text, to highlight certain words or phrases.
5. Horizontal Rule: I have used horizontal rules to visually separate sections.
