## Why this topic matters

Navigation properties and routing are two important concepts in ASP.NET MVC. Navigation properties allow you to easily traverse between related entities in your data model, while routing allows you to define how users navigate to different pages in your application.

Navigation properties are particularly useful when you are working with large data sets. They allow you to avoid having to write explicit code to navigate between related entities, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

Routing is also an important concept in ASP.NET MVC. It allows you to define how users navigate to different pages in your application by specifying the URL that they should use. This can make your application more user-friendly and easier to navigate.

## Answering the questions

### What are navigation properties?

Navigation properties are a way of linking related entities in your data model. They allow you to easily traverse between related entities, without having to write explicit code.

For example, if you have a `Customer` entity and a `Order` entity, you can create a navigation property called `Orders` on the `Customer` entity. This navigation property will allow you to easily retrieve all of the `Order` entities that are associated with a particular `Customer` entity.

### What are the benefits of using navigation properties?

There are several benefits to using navigation properties. They can help you to:

* Avoid writing explicit code to navigate between related entities.
* Improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of database queries that need to be executed.
* Make your code more readable and maintainable.

### What are routes?

Routes are a way of defining how users navigate to different pages in your application. They allow you to specify the URL that users should use to access a particular page.

For example, you might have a route that maps the URL `/customers` to the `Customers` controller. This would allow users to access the `Customers` controller by navigating to the URL `/customers` in their web browser.

### What are the benefits of using routes?

There are several benefits to using routes. They can help :

* Make your application more user-friendly by providing a clear and consistent way for users to navigate to different pages.
* Improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of database queries that need to be executed.
* Make your code more readable and maintainable.

## Analogy

A navigation property can be thought of as a hyperlink in a web page. It allows you to easily navigate to a related page, without having to write explicit code.

A route can be thought of as the URL of a web page. It defines how users can access a particular page by specifying the URL that they should use.
