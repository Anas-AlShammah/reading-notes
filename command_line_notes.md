# Command Line Notes

In this prework, I explored the Bash Command Line Tutorials on ryanstutorials.net. Here are my observations and learnings from each tutorial segment:

## The Command Line

- Understanding: The command line is a powerful tool that allows me to interact with my computer using text-based commands. It provides a direct way to navigate the file system and execute various tasks.
- Learnings:
  - Opening the terminal: I can open the terminal on my computer by using the keyboard shortcut or searching for the terminal application.
  - Basic commands: I learned essential commands like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and `clear` to check the current working directory, list files and directories, navigate through directories, and clear the terminal screen.
  - Executing commands: To execute a command, I type it in the terminal and press Enter.

## Basic Navigation

- Understanding: Navigating the Linux directory system is crucial for efficient command line usage.
- Learnings:
  - Absolute and relative paths: I learned about absolute and relative paths to specify the location of files and directories.
  - `cd` command: The `cd` command is used to change directories. I can use it with absolute or relative paths.
  - Directory shortcuts: I discovered shortcuts like `~` for the home directory and `..` for the parent directory, which make navigation more convenient.

## More About Files

- Understanding: Files and directories have various properties and attributes in a Linux environment.
- Learnings:
  - File types: I learned about different file types, including regular files, directories, symbolic links, and more.
  - File permissions: Understanding file permissions is crucial for managing access rights. I learned about the `chmod` command and symbolic representation of permissions.
  - Hidden files: Files and directories starting with a dot (`.`) are considered hidden and are not shown in regular listings.

## Manual Pages

- Understanding: The manual pages provide detailed information about command usage and options.
- Learnings:
  - Accessing manual pages: I learned to use the `man` command followed by the command name to access the manual pages.
  - Navigating in the manual pages: The manual pages can be scrolled using the arrow keys or the `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys. Pressing `q` exits the manual pages.

## File Manipulation

- Understanding: Manipulating files and directories is an essential skill in the command line.
- Learnings:
  - Creating files and directories: I can create files using the `touch` command and directories using the `mkdir` command.
  - Renaming and moving files: The `mv` command allows renaming files and moving them to different locations.
  - Copying files and directories: The `cp` command is used to make copies of files and directories.
  - Removing files and directories: The `rm` command is used to delete files, and the `rmdir` command is used to remove empty directories.

## Cheat Sheet

- Understanding: The cheat sheet provides a quick reference for the main points covered in the tutorial.
- Learnings: I made use of the cheat sheet as a handy reference for frequently used commands and their syntax.

These tutorials have provided me with a solid foundation in using the command line. I feel more comfortable navigating directories, managing files, and executing various commands. I am excited to continue exploring and honing my skills in the command line environment.
