# Exception Handling

## Why This Topic Matters
Exception handling is crucial in software development to handle unexpected errors and exceptional situations. Understanding exception handling is essential for building robust and reliable software systems.

## Reading Assignment

### Debugging for absolute beginners
- Major benefit of tracing the call stack: Tracing the call stack provides valuable information about the sequence of method calls leading to an exception, aiding in identifying the root cause.

### Try/Catch Blocks
- Exception I'd like to 'catch' and handle in day-to-day life: NullReferenceException - gracefully handling situations where objects or values are expected but might be missing or null.
- Downsides to try/catch blocks from an efficiency standpoint: There can be performance overhead due to the exception handling process, impacting overall efficiency, especially if used excessively or in performance-critical code sections.

### Exception Handling
- Explaining the .NET approach to exception handling to a non-technical friend: Exception handling is like having a safety net in acrobatics, catching errors and allowing graceful recovery, preventing program crashes.

### Case Studies: Therac-25 and Ariane 5
- Glaring mistakes in Therac-25: Lack of proper validation and synchronization of hardware and software inputs, insufficient testing, and inadequate safety measures.
- Glaring mistakes in Ariane 5: Reusing software code without considering the different flight characteristics, leading to an arithmetic overflow error, insufficient error handling, and neglecting the impact of legacy code.

- How can exception handling be optimized for efficiency without sacrificing reliability?
- Best practices for handling and logging exceptions in large-scale software systems.
