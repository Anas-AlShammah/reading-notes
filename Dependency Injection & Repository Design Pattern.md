# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## Why this topic matters

Dependency injection (DI) and the repository design pattern are two important concepts in software development. DI allows us to decouple our code from its dependencies, which makes our code more modular, testable, and maintainable. The repository design pattern provides a way to abstract our data access logic, which makes our code more reusable and easier to test.

## Questions

* What is dependency injection?
* What is the repository design pattern?
* How do DI and the repository design pattern work together?
* What are the benefits of using DI and the repository design pattern?
* When should I use DI and the repository design pattern?

## Answers

* Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows us to separate the instantiation of a class from its usage. This makes our code more loosely coupled, which means that our classes are less dependent on each other. This makes our code easier to test and maintain.
* The repository design pattern is a software design pattern that provides a way to abstract our data access logic. This makes our code more reusable and easier to test.
* DI and the repository design pattern work together by allowing us to inject a repository into a class that needs to access data. This decouples the class from the specific implementation of the repository, which makes the class more reusable and easier to test.
* The benefits of using DI and the repository design pattern include:
    * Loose coupling
    * Testability
    * Reusability
    * Easier to maintain
* You should use DI and the repository design pattern when you need to decouple your code from its dependencies and when you need to abstract your data access logic.

## Analogy

A dependency injection container can be compared to a waiter in a restaurant. The waiter takes your order and then goes to the kitchen to get your food. The kitchen is like the implementation of the dependency, and the waiter is like the DI container. The waiter doesn't need to know how the food is made, it just needs to know what you ordered. This is similar to how the DI container doesn't need to know how the dependency is implemented, it just needs to know what dependency you need.

## Things I want to know more about

* I would like to learn more about the different ways to implement dependency injection.
* I would also like to learn more about the different types of repository design patterns.

## Conclusion

Dependency injection and the repository design pattern are two important concepts in software development. They can help us to write more modular, testable, and maintainable code.
