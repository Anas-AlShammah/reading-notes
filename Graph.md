Graph Basics:

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (line segments).
Common Graph Terminology:

Vertex (Node): A data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge: A connection between two nodes.
Neighbor: Nodes connected via an edge to a given node.
Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
Types of Graphs:

Undirected Graph: All edges are undirected or bi-directional.
Directed Graph (Digraph): Every edge has a specific direction.
Complete Graph: All nodes are connected to all other nodes.
Connected Graph: All nodes have at least one edge.
Disconnected Graph: Some nodes may not have edges.
Acyclic Graph: No cycles (a path that ends at the same node).
Cyclic Graph: Contains cycles.
Graph Representation:

Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array representing connections between vertices.
Adjacency List: A collection of linked lists or arrays listing adjacent vertices.
Weighted Graphs:

Weighted graphs have weights (numbers) assigned to their edges.
Graph Traversals:

Breadth-First Traversal: Visits nodes level by level, using a queue.
Depth-First Traversal: Visits nodes depth-wise, using a stack or recursion.
Real-World Uses of Graphs:

GPS and Mapping
Driving Directions
Social Networks
Airline Traffic
Recommendation Systems (e.g., Netflix)
Graphs are versatile data structures used in various applications, making them a fundamental concept in computer science and data analysis.
